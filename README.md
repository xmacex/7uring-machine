# turing-machine

A Turing machine generative sequencer thing. Written for [seamstress](https://llllllll.co/t/seamstress-v0-15-1/62356) while I'm away from my norns.

The idea (for myself) is to build the shift register using bitwise operations only. Thank you to Sound + Voltage for explaining how the thing works on the video [*Turing 201: Turing Machine Explained (More than you ever needed to know...)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va2XAdFtmeU).
